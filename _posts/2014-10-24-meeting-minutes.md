## Club Website discussion

Held a brief discussion about the pros and cons of a Wix website versus a GitHub pages website.

### Wix

#### Pros
1. Easy to use, web-based WYSIWYG editor (easy for newcomers)
2. Pre-configured templates
3. Tons of applets
4. Full CMS (content management system)

#### Cons:
1. Not free
2. Unsure about the underlying file structure
3. CMS drawbacks (database management, etc.) (?)

### GitHub pages

#### Pros
1. Already paid for
2. Static site content/no server-side management
3. Already know management tool-chain (Git)

#### Cons
1. Management tool-chain probably difficult for newcomers
2. Not much built in
3. Not dynamic

Ultimately it seems the GitHub pages static website was the settled-upon choice, primarily due to the cost factor. Seems like a tutorial on writing pages and blog posts will be a necessity.
