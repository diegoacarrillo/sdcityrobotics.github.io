What is SCSS?
-------------

SCSS is a web programming language used the same way as CSS: for styling web-pages. It's purpose is to provide features that are otherwise missing from CSS, things like variables, nesting, general object oriented structures, etc.

It is actually the reinvention of another CSS preprocessed language and its predecessor, SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets).

There's a lot to go over in learning the caveats of SCSS so, instead repasting articles, try looking over some of the links in the [references section](#references).
