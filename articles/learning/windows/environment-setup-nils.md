My Linux programming environment isn't much in terms of complexity. I use the following on a regular basis:

- gVim and a bunch of plugins
- Git

...two programs and that's pretty much it. But I also want to do work on my Windows desktop, but I don't want to use different tools. This article will go over the steps I took to setup my personal development environment.

Vim

Vim is the best text editor I've ever worked with. I have it setup to work like an entire IDE. The down side is that it takes a lot of time and initial frustration to get used to, but once you do you wont ever want to have to go back to anything else, and you wont have to because literally every computer with any sort of Unix like toolchain will have Vim or Vi.

Setup of a generic Vim and gVim environment in Windows is trivial; download the installer at the [Downloading Vim](http://www.vim.org/download.php) page. But my Vim environment doesn't feel complete without the amazing [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) (YCM) code-completion engine.
